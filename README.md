### This project was developed for an Image Processing and Analysis course at the University of Coimbra.  

To run the application, you need IDL or an open source alternative (GDL). 

Once activated, the app will invite you to upload 12 images, do optional croppping and brightness/contrast adjustments to create 12 square-shaped tiles, with which you will then be able to play your own customized version of the famous 2048 game.
